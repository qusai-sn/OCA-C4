# Welcome to Qusai Alsenjalawi's Private Repository

Welcome to my private repository, where you'll find organized folders dedicated to different aspects of my learning journey at Orange Coding Academy. Here's a breakdown of each folder:

## What You'll Find:

### My Learning:
Explore my learning timeline and access tasks and assignments submitted during the bootcamp. The `learning-timeline.md` file provides an overview of my progress, while the `tasks-and-assignments` directory contains folders organized by date, each containing markdown files for tasks and assignments.

### Projects:
Discover the projects I've been working on during the bootcamp. Each project folder contains source code in the `src` directory, along with a `README.md` file providing documentation and instructions.

### Side Projects:
Explore smaller side projects or experiments I've been working on alongside my main coursework. Each side project folder includes source code in the `src` directory and a `README.md` file with project details.

### Resources:
Access supplementary learning materials recommended by the academy. This includes lectures, tutorials, articles, and other resources to deepen understanding and master new concepts.

### Feedback Loop:
Engage in a constructive feedback loop with coaches. Receive guidance, suggestions, and mentorship on your coding journey to help you grow and improve as a developer.
