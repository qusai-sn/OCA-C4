# Welcome to Qusai Alsenjalawi's Private Repository

Welcome to my private repository, dedicated to documenting my progress and facilitating task submission and review for coaches at Orange Coding Academy. Here's how this repository is organized for efficient use:

## What You'll Find:

### My Learning:
Explore my learning timeline and access tasks and assignments submitted during the bootcamp. The `learning-timeline.md` file provides an overview of my progress. Tasks and assignments are organized chronologically from May to October, allowing coaches to track my development over time.

### Projects:
Discover the projects I've been working on during the bootcamp. Each project folder contains source code in the `src` directory, along with a `README.md` file providing documentation and instructions. Coaches can review my project work to assess my coding skills and understanding of programming concepts.

### Side Projects:
Explore smaller side projects or experiments I've been working on alongside my main coursework. Each side project folder includes source code in the `src` directory and a `README.md` file with project details. Coaches can gain insight into my creativity and exploration of additional topics.

### Resources:
Access supplementary learning materials recommended by the academy. This includes lectures, tutorials, articles, and other resources to deepen understanding and master new concepts. Coaches can refer to these resources to provide targeted guidance and support.

### Task Submissions:
Submit completed assignments and coding tasks directly to this repository. Each task submission is organized neatly in its respective folder within the `my-learning` directory, making it easy for coaches to review and provide feedback. The timeline structure from May to October ensures that tasks are easily traceable and accessible.

### Feedback Loop:
Engage in a constructive feedback loop with coaches. Receive guidance, suggestions, and mentorship on your coding journey to help you grow and improve as a developer. Coaches can provide feedback directly on task submissions and project work, fostering continuous improvement and skill development.

This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of my progress throughout the Orange Coding Academy bootcamp, showcasing my learning journey, project work, and development as a software developer.

Thank you for entrusting me with your feedback and guidance as I navigate through the Orange Coding Academy bootcamp. Let's code and learn together!
